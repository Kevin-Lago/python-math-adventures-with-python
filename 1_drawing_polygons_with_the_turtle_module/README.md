# Drawing Polygons with the Turtle Module

Python's turtle module's "turtle" agent is based on the [Logo programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)), which was invented in the 1960's to make computer programming more accessible to everyone.

Python's turtle module lets you control a small image shaped like a turtle, just like a video game character.
